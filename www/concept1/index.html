            You know user research helps you understand problems to design better products. <br/>
            But it's hard for this research to tell a clear story; to ensure all your data, from every source, is organized and shared across your entire team. We want to change that.

                <p class="BenefitContent-Copy">
                    By defining problem areas in your software &mdash; areas that you know of, but want to better understand &mdash; your team stays focused on the right things. This prevents broken windows from staying that way.
                </p>
                <p class="BenefitContent-Copy">
                    Additionally, for every problem you define a few key words and phrases that would commonly surface during user interviews, in feedback forms, or within support tickets. These come in handy later.

                <p class="BenefitContent-Copy">
                    The content of your research is automatically scanned in search of keyword matches in any of your problem areas. Findings are easily described and categorized, right as your data is collected.
                </p>
                <p class="BenefitContent-Copy">
                    This applies whether you're entering data directly, or importing it from another source (like a Google Doc). Everything ends up stored in one place. No insight falls through the cracks.

                <p class="BenefitContent-Copy">
                    No more searching, sifting, and mining. Everything you already know about a problem, all in one place, in a concise easy-to-read stream. Let your research tell a story. 
                </p>
                <p class="BenefitContent-Copy">
                    Everyone on your team can understand how each of your users deals with the problem areas in your software based on user interviews, usability tests, and support tickets. 
                </p>

                    See at a glance what problems your team is learning about, how the research is done, and where your blind spots are. Then adjust as necessary.  
                </p>
                <p class="BenefitContent-Copy">
                    Additionally, "smart problem areas" automatically surface from data correlations found across your entire body of research. This allows you to find problems you didn't know existed, and connect dots that we're there before.
