        <p>Hello,</p>

        <p>As hinted at above, we're building a tool that we think can really improve the user research process on software teams. We are such a team, and we've dealt with some of the pain points of organizing and making sense of research.</p>

        <p>We think there are at least a few other teams out there who've dealt with these same pain points. If you're on one of them, and you'd like to hear more about what we're working on, we'd love to talk.</p>

        <p>Please fill out this quick form and we'll be in touch.</p> 

        <p>If you're looking for more, you can also check out our blog.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your time.</p>

        <p>Craig, Nick, and Nick.</p>
