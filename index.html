        <p>Hello,</p>

        <p>As hinted at above, we're building a tool that we think can really improve the user research process on software teams. Why are we so sure? Well, we are such a team. We've dealt with many of the pain points around organizing and making sense of research.</p>

        <p>We think there are at least a few other teams out there who've dealt with these same pain points. <strong>If you're on one of them, and you'd like to hear more about what we're working on, we'd love to talk.</strong></p>

        <p>Just fill out this 7 question survey, provide your email, and we'll be in touch.</p>
